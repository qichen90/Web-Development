1.movie trailer project

The project was done when I took the online class on Udacity. The website contains several trailers of my favorite movies. When you click on the specific moive picture, a window of trailer will show on the current website. The project was implemented in Python.

The original code of fresh_tomatoes.py was from https://github.com/adarsh0806/ud036_StarterCode/blob/master/fresh_tomatoes.py.

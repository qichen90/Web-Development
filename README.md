# Web-Development
<h3>1.movie trailer project</h3>
The project was done when I took the online class on Udacity. The website contains several trailers of my favorite movies. When you click on the specific moive picture, a window of trailer will show on the current website. The project was implemented in Python.
The original code of fresh_tomatoes.py was from https://github.com/adarsh0806/ud036_StarterCode/blob/master/fresh_tomatoes.py.

<h3>2.tournament project</h3>
In this project, I wrote a Python module that uses the PostgreSQL database to keep track of players and matches in a game tournament. The project description is here https://docs.google.com/document/d/16IgOm4XprTaKxAa8w02y028oBECOoB1EI1ReddADEeY/pub?embedded=true.

<h3>3.restaurant_menu_app project</h3>
In this project, I developed an application that provides a list of restaurants and menuitems within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to create, edit and delete their own restaurants and menuitems.

The web server was built on the virtual machine, so it is able to access the website on the Internet. But in the later project, I provided better codes and way to access the website through Heroku.

<h3>4.restaurant-menu-web project</h3>
In this version of restaurant menu projects, I used Heroku to deploy my application to the Internet. You can take a look at my application on: http://restaurant-menu-web.herokuapp.com/

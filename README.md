<h3>1.movie trailer project</h3>
The project was done when I took the online class on Udacity. The website contains several trailers of my favorite movies. When you click on the specific moive picture, a window of trailer will show on the current website. The project was implemented in Python.
The original code of fresh_tomatoes.py was from https://github.com/adarsh0806/ud036_StarterCode/blob/master/fresh_tomatoes.py.

<h3>2.tournament project</h3>
In this project, I wrote a Python module that uses the PostgreSQL database to keep track of players and matches in a game tournament. The project description is here https://docs.google.com/document/d/16IgOm4XprTaKxAa8w02y028oBECOoB1EI1ReddADEeY/pub?embedded=true.
